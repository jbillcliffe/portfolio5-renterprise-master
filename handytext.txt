https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/z-index/ --- Z-index documentation, was useful to know there were default values
for different bootstrap components!

@login_required is needed, this also means that the user has to have a verified email too. Therefore not needing @verified_email_addres from allauth

PAGINATOR - Prior to moving to grid display. It would centre on the middle item and you could not set a starting column for the text element.
Hence, when there was only left or right. The paginatior would very clearly move, because the middle element 
was an arrow (text/arrow/arrow or arrow/arrow/text). Grid enables a consistent size, even for blank columns, which can be centred in the parent div.

SIDEBAR - For a time, the href and target values were persisting although I believed it should have gone, but, the if/else statement was incorrect, 
then realising target=_self was refreshing the page too. However, with a rescripting in the nav the cursor is not a pointer and it does not have navigation.
This was discovered at the early stages when creating the link for the profiles list.

# Ordering
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/#order-classes

Buttons were ignoring the ordering (not sure why as they were inside the same parent tag as fields). Instead, took the buttons outside of the form and they render perfectly underneath.
**** FIGURED OUT ****
Bootstrap order class on grid layout has tiers 1 throught to 5 by default, although more can be added. This was discovered after an already working implementation, so no requirement to change.
