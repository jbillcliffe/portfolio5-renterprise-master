https://docs.allauth.org/en/latest/common/admin.html -- !!!! Make Django admin login requires allauth 

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/z-index/ --- Z-index documentation, was useful to know there were default values
for different bootstrap components!

@login_required is needed, this also means that the user has to have a verified email too. Therefore not needing @verified_email_addres from allauth

PAGINATOR - Prior to moving to grid display. It would centre on the middle item and you could not set a starting column for the text element.
Hence, when there was only left or right. The paginatior would very clearly move, because the middle element 
was an arrow (text/arrow/arrow or arrow/arrow/text). Grid enables a consistent size, even for blank columns, which can be centred in the parent div.

SIDEBAR - For a time, the href and target values were persisting although I believed it should have gone, but, the if/else statement was incorrect, 
then realising target=_self was refreshing the page too. However, with a rescripting in the nav the cursor is not a pointer and it does not have navigation.
This was discovered at the early stages when creating the link for the profiles list.
